   "Fully vaccinated” doesn’t mean “immune to COVID-19”
   </h1>
   <p> 
   As restrictions and mask man dates are dropped around the county, people who are fully vaccinated might be
   feeling the return-to-normal fantasy. But Dr. Card on a warns that now still isn’t the time to let your guard
   down. While the vaccines are potent, there’s still a chance that you could become infected.
 <br><br>
   Dr.Cardona explains.<br><br>
   “Fully vaccinated" means that you completed a COVID-19 vaccine series as recommended for the best
   protection against severe complications such as hospitalizations and/or death. No vaccine offers 100%
   protection against illness, yet it does give you a better chance to fight off the infectious consequences of being
   exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus”.
   <br><br>
 <h2>  Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to others, including other vaccinated people?
   </h2>
   While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 may occur at a lower rate. She adds
   that this could also be areality for people who don’t have a good immune response to vaccines.
   <br><br>
   “The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health disorders may
   not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccines. We are still collecting data
   and doing on going research about the vaccine responses in these vulnerable populations”.
