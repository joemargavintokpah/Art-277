    <h2> What is Lemme Help?</h2>
     Helping Hands is a non-profit organization dedicated to serving those most at-risk to COVID-19:
     senior citizens, the immune compromised, and people with pre-existing medical conditions which
     put them at additional risk.
     <br/><br/>
     Our community volunteers and delivery partners deliver groceries, medicine, and other necessary
     supplies to empower everyone to stay healthy and be as responsible as they can be.
